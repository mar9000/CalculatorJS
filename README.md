# MPS Calculator tutorial in JavaScript

This project serves as an example of using MPS to generate JavaScript code.

## Introduction

JetBrains MPS (http://jetbrains.com/mps) is a projectional language workbench. ECMAScript4MPS (https://github.com/mar9000/ecmascript4mps) is the implementation of the [ECMAScript 5.1](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/) for MPS.
The MPS Calculator tutorial (https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/help/mps-calculator-language-tutorial.html) guides students through the process of building a DSL for creating simple Java Swing calculation forms. This project implements similar functionality, but targets html/javascript as the target platform.
